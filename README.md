# Optimization-FantasyFootballTeam
Finding the Ideal Football Team for English Premier League
-------------------------

This optimization project is an attempt to find the best lineup for the official Fantasy English Premier League football. The best lineup will be based on two factors â€“ the points scored by the player in the past and the current form of the player. The project attempts to select a team of 15 players using a Multi-objective model using the Goal Programming approach. Alternate Scenarios where objective was either to maximize the overall score or overall form were also explored.
